Inner Source is the deployment of Open Source practices of code and information sharing within the context of a single organisation. By sharing, we reduce duplication, free up cognitive space to enable innovation, and increase the speed of delivery.
 
However, repositories set to “open” are insufficient to ensure that this sharing is taking place. Search tools generally have a narrow focus; they rely on specificity.
 
The solution is a Discovery tool, whereby developers can find solutions and information they weren’t necessarily expecting but nevertheless prove helpful. The power of Artificial Intelligence has enabled the creation of this tool; clever programming techniques can ensure that it is light on resources, serving models with Databricks using a CPU cluster instead of a GPU one.
 
Enter Project Fleming. Originally devised for Shell, this model-agnostic, AI-powered Discovery Tool is now Open Source. We invite contributors as well as users, as we work towards enabling Discovery for all organisations that look to power their Inner Source initiatives, or indeed, want to use Artificial Intelligence to perform specialised Discovery tasks.
